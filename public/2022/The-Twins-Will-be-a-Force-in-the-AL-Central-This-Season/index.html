        <h1 id="The-Twins-Will-be-a-Force-in-the-AL-Central-This-Season"><a href="#The-Twins-Will-be-a-Force-in-the-AL-Central-This-Season" class="headerlink" title="The Twins Will be a Force in the AL Central This Season"></a>The Twins Will be a Force in the AL Central This Season</h1><p>Despite their 47-115 record in 2017, the Minnesota Twins will be a force to be reckoned with this upcoming season.</p>
<p>Jose Berrios, the team’s ace, is coming off of a 2017 season in which he pitched to a 3.89 ERA and 10.06 K&#x2F;9 ratio. He has the potential to be one of the best pitchers in baseball, and will anchor the Twins’ rotation.</p>
<p>Ervin Santana, who pitched to a 3.28 ERA last season, will also be a key part of the Twins’ rotation. In addition, youngsters like Kyle Gibson and Jose De Leon could surprise people this season and contribute to the Twins’ success.</p>
<p>The Twins bullpen also looks considerably improved heading into the 2018 season. Addison Reed, Fernando Rodney, and Zach Duke all provide veteran leadership and stability to an otherwise young bullpen unit.</p>
<p>Offensively, Miguel Sano and Eddie Rosario are two of the most exciting players on the team. Sano batted .264 with 28 home runs last season, while Rosario hit .269 with 27 home runs. With Byron Buxton also returning to form after a disappointing 2017 season, the Twins lineup looks formidable.</p>
<p>Fans in Minnesota should be excited for what is sure to be an improved Twins team in 2018. With several talented young players and a solid veteran core, they will be contenders in the AL Central this season.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Brian-Dozier-Lead-the-Twins-to-Another-Playoff-Berth"><a href="#Can-Brian-Dozier-Lead-the-Twins-to-Another-Playoff-Berth" class="headerlink" title="Can Brian Dozier Lead the Twins to Another Playoff Berth?"></a>Can Brian Dozier Lead the Twins to Another Playoff Berth?</h1><p>Minnesota Twins second baseman Brian Dozier is coming off of a career year in which he led the American League in home runs with 42. Dozier’s powerful bat and stellar defense will be pivotal for the Twins as they look to earn their third consecutive playoff berth.</p>
<p>Dozier has always been known for his power, but he took his game to another level in 2017. His .271 batting average was also a career high, and he proved that he can be a complete player by posting a .354 on-base percentage and stealing 21 bases.</p>
<p>The Twins are stacked with young talent, including outfielder Byron Buxton and third baseman Miguel Sano, both of whom are perennial All-Stars in the making. With an offense that can rival any team in the league, the Twins’ success this season will hinge on their pitching staff.</p>
<p>Led by Ervin Santana and Jose Berrios, the Twins’ rotation is headlined by two young pitchers who are coming off of impressive seasons. If Santana and Berrios can continue to pitch like they did last year, and the rest of the pitching staff can stay healthy, the Twins have a chance to make some noise in the American League.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not Brian Dozier can lead the Twins to another playoff berth, but there is no doubt that he is one of the most talented players on their team. With his combination of power and defense, Dozier is a key player who could help bring a championship to Minnesota.</p>
<h1 id="Ervin-Santana-Is-Crucial-to-Twins’-Success-in-2017"><a href="#Ervin-Santana-Is-Crucial-to-Twins’-Success-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Ervin Santana Is Crucial to Twins’ Success in 2017"></a>Ervin Santana Is Crucial to Twins’ Success in 2017</h1><p>Coming into the 2017 season, the Minnesota Twins knew they had a good young nucleus of players in place. Byron Buxton, Brian Dozier, Max Kepler and Jorge Polanco all showed promise in 2016. The biggest question mark for the Twins was their starting rotation.</p>
<p>They answered that question by signing Ervin Santana to a four-year, $55 million contract in February. Santana had a great 2016 season with the Atlanta Braves, going 12-10 with a 3.38 ERA in 31 starts.</p>
<p>He has picked up right where he left off this season, going 7-2 with a 2.75 ERA in 13 starts. The Twins are 11-2 in Santana’s starts this season and 10-6 overall when he pitches.</p>
<p>Santana is not only having a great season on the mound, but also at the plate. He is hitting .326 (16-for-49) with two home runs and nine RBIs this season.</p>
<p>The Twins are in first place in the American League Central Division with a 38-25 record. They would not be in first place without Santana, who has been their most consistent starter this season.</p>
<h1 id="Byron-Buxton-Is-Ready-to-Take-Over-the-League"><a href="#Byron-Buxton-Is-Ready-to-Take-Over-the-League" class="headerlink" title="Byron Buxton Is Ready to Take Over the League"></a>Byron Buxton Is Ready to Take Over the League</h1><p>In 2015, Byron Buxton was the number one prospect in all of baseball. He had a great season at Triple-A, and many people were excited to see what he could do in the majors. However, he struggled in his first taste of big league action, hitting just .209 in 47 games.</p>
<p>Buxton’s glove is already one of the best in the game, and his bat is only going to get better. He is primed for a breakout season in 2017, and he is going to take over the league.</p>
<p>Last year, Buxton hit .251 with 24 home runs and 88 RBIs at Triple-A. He also stole 29 bases and had a .323 on-base percentage. His power numbers were down from the previous season, but that is to be expected from a young player who is still learning how to hit at the highest level.</p>
<p>Buxton has made some adjustments to his swing this offseason, and those changes are going to pay dividends this year. He is now using his natural speed to create more power, and he is also keeping his hands inside the ball better. As a result, we should see more balls flying out of the park this season.</p>
<p>The Twins offense was bad last year, but it will be much improved this season with Buxton leading the way. He has all of the tools necessary to be an MVP-caliber player, and Twins fans are in for a treat this year.</p>
<h1 id="Miguel-Sano-Could-Determine-the-Twins’-Fate-in-2017"><a href="#Miguel-Sano-Could-Determine-the-Twins’-Fate-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Miguel Sano Could Determine the Twins’ Fate in 2017"></a>Miguel Sano Could Determine the Twins’ Fate in 2017</h1><p>The Minnesota Twins are a team in transition. They have one of the youngest rosters in baseball, and they are looking to their young players to step up and lead the team in 2017. One of those players is Miguel Sano.</p>
<p>Sano had a solid rookie season in 2016, hitting 18 home runs and driving in 52 runs. He also showed good plate discipline, batting .269 with an on-base percentage of .353. If he can build on that success in 2017, the Twins will be in good shape.</p>
<p>Sano is still just 23 years old, and he has a lot of potential. He has already shown that he can hit for power, and if he can continue to improve his plate discipline, he could be a major force at the plate.</p>
<p>The Twins are counting on Sano to take a step forward in 2017 and lead them back to the playoffs. If he can do that, they will be in good shape heading into the future.</p>
