        <h1 id="California-Gambles-on-Gambling-Legalization"><a href="#California-Gambles-on-Gambling-Legalization" class="headerlink" title="California Gambles on Gambling Legalization"></a>California Gambles on Gambling Legalization</h1><p>2016 was a big year for gambling in California. The state legislature approved a constitutional amendment to allow full-scale casino gambling, including casinos, card clubs and racetracks. The amendment was placed on the November ballot as Proposition 68, where it was approved by a wide margin.</p>
<p>The new law allows for up to eight casinos, including one in each of the state’s major metropolitan areas: Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento, Central Valley, Southern California Coast, Palm Springs-Desert Cities, North Coast and Lake Tahoe. In addition to casinos, card clubs (which are like private casinos) will be allowed in every city that currently has one. Racetracks will also be able to offer slot machines and other casino games.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure said it would create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state. Opponents argued that it would lead to increased crime and social ills.</p>
<p>So far, only two casinos have been licensed: one in downtown Sacramento and one in San Diego. Licensing is a slow process, as the state tries to ensure that applicants meet all the requirements set out in the new law. </p>
<p>So what does this mean for gamblers in California? Here’s a rundown of what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now gamble at licensed casinos, card clubs and racetracks throughout the state.</li>
<li>Gambling is legal from age 21 onwards (earlier if you are on a tribal reservation).</li>
<li>Casinos can offer slots, table games and poker.</li>
<li>Card clubs can offer poker and other table games. </li>
<li>Racetracks can offer slots and other casino games. </li>
<li>There’s no smoking or vaping inside gambling facilities – this includes electronic cigarettes.</li>
<li>You can travel to other states to gamble (but not Nevada – see below).</li>
<li>There are strict regulations about how much money you can bring into a casino or take out with you (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>What about online gambling? This is still illegal in California, as it is in most states. However, there is an effort underway to legalize it, so stay tuned for updates on that front.</p>
<p>Gambling laws vary from state to state in the US. Some states have lotteries, while others allow Tribal casinos only. Some allow commercial casinos while others don’t. Nevada is the only state where gambling is completely legal – you can find just about any type of gambling game you want there (including sports betting).<br>However, there are some restrictions on gambling within California that don’t exist in Nevada (or most other states). For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Californians cannot travel to Nevada specifically to gamble – they have to go for some other reason too (e.g., visit family or friends). This restriction doesn’t apply to people from other states travelling to Nevada to gamble; they are free to do so as long as they abide by Nevada law while there. 2) Californians are limited in how much money they can bring into or take out of a casino – this limit varies depending on the type of casino but is typically around $1,000 per day (this rule doesn’t apply outside of California).  3) Gambling is illegal for anyone under 21 years old (this applies statewide; there are no Tribal exemptions).  4) Commercial casinos cannot be built in certain cities or counties – these include Los Angeles County, San Diego County, Riverside County and several others .This list changes from time to time so make sure you check before heading out for some gaming fun!</li>
</ol>
<p>So what does this all mean for gamblers in California? In short: plenty of places to gamble now throughout the state; fairly restrictive laws about how much money you can bring into&#x2F;take out of a casino; no online gambling yet but it may be coming soon; and overall fairly liberal laws when compared with other states in the US</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Gambles-on-New-Casino-to-Boost-Economy"><a href="#Delaware-Gambles-on-New-Casino-to-Boost-Economy" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Gambles on New Casino to Boost Economy"></a>Delaware Gambles on New Casino to Boost Economy</h1><p>In May 2018, Delaware became the first state to legalize online gambling. This is seen as a way to boost the state’s economy. Delaware has long been in competition with New Jersey and Pennsylvania to be the leading gambling destination in the northeast United States.</p>
<p>The new casino, dubbed “Delaware Online,” will offer slots, blackjack, and roulette. It will be available only to Delaware residents and will be operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation. The company also operates three brick-and-mortar casinos in Delaware.</p>
<p>Governor John Carney commented on the new casino, saying, “This is an important day for the State of Delaware as we continue to lead the way in creating broad-based economic opportunity for our citizens. The launch of our newest casino - Delaware Online - expands gaming options for our residents and builds on our commitment to bolster tourism and create good jobs in Delaware.”</p>
<p>Some opponents of online gambling note that there is a risk of addiction, but supporters say that such risks are already present with traditional casinos. They also point out that online gambling can be regulated more tightly than traditional casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Gambles-on-Diversifying-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#Florida-Gambles-on-Diversifying-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Florida Gambles on Diversifying Gambling Industry"></a>Florida Gambles on Diversifying Gambling Industry</h1><p>Florida lawmakers made a big gamble this year, approving legislation to permit three new forms of gambling in the state. The move is aimed at diversifying the gambling industry and bringing in much-needed tax revenue. But will the bet pay off?</p>
<p>The new forms of gambling include poker rooms, daily fantasy sports, and sports betting. They will be overseen by the Florida Gaming Commission, which is responsible for licensing and regulating all forms of gambling in the state.</p>
<p>While some opponents argue that the move will lead to more addiction and social problems, supporters say it will bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the state. They point to studies that show that regulated gambling is safe and generates significant economic benefits.</p>
<p>The new gambling venues are expected to open by early 2020. In the meantime, there is much work to be done in setting up the regulatory framework. The Florida Gaming Commission has already started meeting with stakeholders and drafting regulations.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how successful the new gambling ventures will be. But one thing is clear: Florida is taking a risk in hoping they will pan out.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Gambles-on-Revenue-from-Gambling-Expansion"><a href="#Illinois-Gambles-on-Revenue-from-Gambling-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Gambles on Revenue from Gambling Expansion"></a>Illinois Gambles on Revenue from Gambling Expansion</h1><p>Illinois is preparing to take a gamble with its impending gambling expansion. The state is banking on increased revenue from casino and gambling expansions in order to close a $1.8 billion budget deficit. This decision has come under scrutiny, as the legality of some of the proposed activities is still uncertain.</p>
<p>The Illinois legislature has been working on a gambling expansion package for over a year. The original proposal called for six new casinos, including one in Chicago. A revised package was released earlier this year that includes nine new casinos, including one in Chicago and four in suburban Cook County. In addition, the revised package authorizes video gaming terminals (VGTs) at truck stops and bars throughout the state.</p>
<p>Governor J.B. Pritzker has backed the gambling expansion proposal, citing the potential for increased revenue to help close the state’s budget deficit. According to Pritzker, the new casinos could generate up to $1.3 billion in annual revenue, while VGTs could bring in an additional $500 million per year.</p>
<p>However, there is significant opposition to the gambling expansion proposal. Critics argue that the legalization of more casinos will lead to an increase in problem gambling and crime. They also note that it is unclear whether the state will be able to collect all of the projected revenue given the current legal uncertainty around some of the proposed activities.</p>
<p>A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of allowing VGTs outside of casinos was filed earlier this year by two anti-gambling groups. The lawsuit contends that allowing VGTs at truck stops and bars violates a constitutional prohibition against casino-style gambling being offered outside of licensed casinos. The case is currently pending before a federal judge.</p>
<p>In addition, there are questions about whether Chicago will be able to license a new casino given that its own gaming ordinance prohibits any new casinos from opening within city limits. The proposed new casino would be located in Rosemont, which is located just outside of Chicago’s boundaries.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Governor Pritzker remains confident that the gambling expansion proposal will ultimately be approved. If it is, Illinois could see a significant influx of new revenue from casino and gambling activities over the next few years</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Gambles-on-Continued-Gaming-Dominance"><a href="#Nevada-Gambles-on-Continued-Gaming-Dominance" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gambles on Continued Gaming Dominance"></a>Nevada Gambles on Continued Gaming Dominance</h1><p>With the explosive popularity of gambling in recent years, states have been looking to capitalize on the opportunity by expanding their gaming offerings. Nevada has long been the dominant market for gambling, but other states are starting to close the gap. In order to maintain its lead, Nevada is planning a major expansion of its gaming industry.</p>
<p>One key part of this expansion is the development of new casinos. There are a number of projects in the works, including a massive development in downtown Las Vegas that will include a casino, hotels, and restaurants. Another project is a new casino being built in Reno. This casino will be specifically aimed at Asian gamblers and is expected to be a major draw for that market.</p>
<p>Nevada is also planning to invest in its existing casinos. Many of these casinos are aging and need significant upgrades if they are to remain competitive. Upgrades include things like new slot machines and tables games, as well as remodeling of the casino floor and hotel rooms.</p>
<p>The goal of all these initiatives is to keep Nevada’s gaming industry ahead of the competition. Other states are certainly watching what Nevada does and may follow its lead in terms of expanding their own gaming industries. If Nevada falls behind, it could lose out on billions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>The future looks bright for Nevada’s gaming industry. The expansion plans should help ensure that the state remains the top market for gambling in the US.</p>
