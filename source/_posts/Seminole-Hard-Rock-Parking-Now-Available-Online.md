#  Paid Parking Begins This Week At Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa

Paid parking at Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa begins this week. The new policy, which went into effect on Tuesday, October 9, will require all guests to pay a $5 parking fee upon arrival.

The casino said that the change is necessary in order to “enhance the guest experience” and improve traffic flow. Parking has long been free at the casino, but the fee will be charged Mon-Thur from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., and Fri-Sun from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.

Guests can still park for free in the valet lot, but there is a two-hour time limit on those spots. Free parking is also available in the self-park garage after 6 p.m., and on weekends.

Those who don’t want to pay for parking can take advantage of Seminole Hard Rock Tampa’s free shuttle service, which runs every 30 minutes from several locations near the casino including Raymond James Stadium, International Plaza, and Westshore Plaza Mall.

The $5 parking fee is in line with what other casinos in the area charge their guests, including MGM Grand Detroit and MotorCity Casino Hotel in Detroit, as well as American Casino & Entertainment properties in Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nevada.
