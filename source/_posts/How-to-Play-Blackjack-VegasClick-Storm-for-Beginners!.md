#  How to Play Blackjack VegasClick Storm for Beginners!

# Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Played with a deck of 52 cards, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 points as possible, without going over.

# To begin playing blackjack, first place your bet by clicking on the chip denominations at the bottom of the screen and then placing your chips on the betting mat. The dealer will then give each player two cards face up.

# The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting 21 points with two cards, or scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21. In order to do this, you can hit (take another card), stand (stick with what you've got), or double down (double your bet and take one more card). You can also split a hand if you are dealt two of the same value card.

# Once both players have completed their hands, the dealer will turn over their card and compare it to each player's total. The player with the highest total wins (unless they go over 21 - in which case they lose) and any chips they have won are paid out.

While luck does play a role in blackjack, following perfect strategy can give you the best chance of winning. There are plenty of resources online that can help teach you how to play perfect blackjack strategy, so make sure to do your research before hitting the tables.

Tip 3: Bet Smaller Amounts

One of the easiest ways to reduce your chances of losing big at blackjack is by betting smaller amounts.

By betting small amounts, you can still enjoy the excitement of gambling without putting yourself at risk financially.

First things first: What is blackjack? Blackjack is a card game where players try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer has two cards, one face up and one face down. Players can either hit (take another card) or stand (stop taking cards). The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. If you go over 21, you " bust" and lose automatically. If the dealers cards equal 21 (called a "blackjack"), the player loses automatically, except if they have also drawn a blackjack- in which case it's a tie.

Now that you know how to play blackjack, let's learn how to win! The key is to understand when to hit and when to stand. Hitting is usually wise when your hand total is between 12 and 16, while standing is generally best when your hand totals are 17 or higher. Many people make the mistake of hitting on 17 or 18, but this can be a costly error because you are more likely to bust with these totals. Another common mistake is standing on soft hands (hands that include an ace), when it may be wiser to hit in order to try and get closer to 21. It's important to remember that the goal is not just to beat the dealer - you also want to avoid busting!
