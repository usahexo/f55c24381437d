2. New vehicles - Along with the new map, there are also supposedly going to be new vehicles added to the game. These include ATVs, trucks, boats, and helicopters. Players will now be able to explore different parts of the map more easily and reach destinations faster. 

3. New weapons - Another eagerly awaited addition are new weapons for players to use in the game. These are said to include guns such as a sniper rifle, an assault rifle, and a submachine gun. With so many new items available, players will have plenty of options for taking on their opponents. 

4. Improved graphics - One of the main complaints about earlier versions of "Battle Royale" was that they had lackluster graphics. However, this is rumored not to be an issue with "BK8". It is said that the graphics have been greatly improved, making for a more immersive gaming experience for players. 

5.Leaderboards- This is another much-requested feature that is finally being added into "BK8".

#  Can I pre-order BK8? 

There’s no word as to whether or not you can pre-order BK8 just yet, though it’s safe to say that if you want one, you should start saving now. The original BK1 totaled almost $1500 on release, so there’s no doubt that the follow-up will be even more expensive.

There are several reasons why the BK8 is likely to be so expensive. First of all, the bike is made from carbon fiber, which is a high-end material that is both strong and lightweight. Additionally, it features a Shimano Alfine Di2 11 speed gear system, hydraulic disk brakes and a top tube battery mount. All of these features add to the cost of the bike.

So, if you’re keen to get your hands on a BK8 as soon as it’s released, start saving now! You can expect to pay somewhere in the region of $2000 for this premium electric bike.

#  When will BK8 be available to download?

BK8, the next version of the popular free and open source word processing software LibreOffice, is scheduled to be released in late September or early October of this year.

This new version includes a number of new and improved features, including:

* A redesigned user interface that is more modern and user-friendly

* Compatibility with Microsoft Office file formats

* Improved performance and stability

* A wider range of supported languages
