#  Exactly how much is the casino from right here Toronto Raptors?

The Toronto Raptors are a basketball team that was founded in 1995. They are located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and are a part of the Eastern Conference in the NBA. The Raptors play their home games at the Scotiabank Arena. The Raptors have been to the playoffs six times and have made it to the NBA Finals once, which they lost to the Golden State Warriors.

The Raptors were founded on November 3, 1995. They were created as an expansion team along with the Vancouver Grizzlies. The team is owned by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd., which also owns the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs, MLS's Toronto FC, and AHL's Toronto Marlies. The President and CEO of MLSE is Larry Tanenbaum. The General Manager of the Raptors is Bobby Webster.

The Raptor's head coach is Nick Nurse who was hired on June 11, 2018 after serving as an assistant coach with the Houston Rockets and the Golden State Warriors. His coaching staff consists of Assistant Coaches Jama Mahlalela, Eric Salgado, Nate Bjorkgren, Patrick Mutombo, Sergio Scariolo and Phil Handy; as well as Director of Sports Science Alex McKechnie.

The Toronto Raptors play their home games at Scotiabank Arena which they moved into for the 1999-2000 season. The arena seats 19,800 fans for basketball games. It was formerly known as Air Canada Centre (ACC). Scotiabank acquired naming rights to the arena in July 2019 in a 20 year agreement reportedly worth $800 million CAD.[1]

The Raptors have had six different uniforms throughout their history. Their current uniforms were introduced in 2016-17 and are similar to their original uniforms from 1995-96. The home jersey is white with red trim while the away jersey is red with white trim. Both jerseys have "Raptors" written across the chest in black lettering with a red maple leaf logo above it. The alternate jersey is black with gold trim and has "Toronto" written across the chest in white lettering with a gold maple leaf logo above it.

The Raptors' primary mascot is Rowdy, an anthropomorphic dinosaur who was introduced in 1997.[2] Other mascots over the years have included Dukey (a humanoid dog), Dino (a two-headed dinosaur), Ace (a falcon), and Spike (an animated raptor).

The Raptors have had six different logos throughout their history. Their original logo from 1995-99 was a simple red raptor head on a white background. This was replaced in 1999-2000 by a silhouette of two basketball players dunking over a raptor head silhouette. This logo was used until 2007 when it was replaced by a new design featuring claw marks over a basketball hoop.[3] In 2013 this logo was replaced by another new design featuring a more realistic raptor head.[4] This logo was used until 2016 when it was replaced by the current logo.[5]
