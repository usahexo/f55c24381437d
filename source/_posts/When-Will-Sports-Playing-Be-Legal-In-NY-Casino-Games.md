#  When Will Sports Playing Be Legal In NY Casino Games?

New York state politicians have been trying to legalize sports playing in casino games for a few years now, but there are still some obstacles in the way. Let’s take a look at what needs to happen before you can legally bet on your favorite team.

First, the legislation has to be passed by the state Assembly and Senate. This is usually not a problem, as both chambers are controlled by Democrats who generally support gambling expansion. However, Governor Andrew Cuomo is a Democrat but also a strong advocate for gun control and he may veto the bill if it includes sports betting.

Assuming the bill does pass, it still has to be approved by the federal government. The law that currently prohibits sports betting nationwide is known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992. This law was passed with the intention of protecting the integrity of sports, but many experts believe that it has instead had the opposite effect. In May 2018, the US Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging PASPA’s constitutionality. If the court rules in favor of repealing PASPA, then New York would be free to legalize sports betting.

If all of these obstacles are overcome, then casinos would have to decide whether or not to offer sports betting. There is no guarantee that it would be profitable, as Nevada is currently the only state where sports betting is legal and it only accounts for 2% of total casino revenue there. Some casinos may decide that it’s not worth offering sports betting when they could make more money from other types of games.

So it’s possible that New Yorkers may be able to legally bet on sports within the next year or two, but there are still some things that need to happen first. In the meantime, you can always place bets with offshore bookmakers without any legal risk.

#  State Approves Sports Betting For Upstate Casinos

Just one day after the US Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that banned most sports betting, the New York State Gaming Commission approved sports betting for three upstate casinos. The vote was unanimous among the five commissioners.

The New York State Gaming Commission has not released details on what the sports betting will look like or when it will be available, but they said it will likely involve mobile betting and kiosks at the casinos.

Patricia Espy, Executive Director of the New York State Gaming Commission, said in a statement: "Today's unanimous vote by the Commissioners is an important next step in implementing sports betting in New York. We will continue to work diligently with our partners at the state's racetracks and in Indian Country to develop regulations that allow for a fair, safe and enjoyable sports betting experience for all New Yorkers."

Governor Andrew Cuomo also praised the Commission's decision, calling it a "a major victory for New York's economy". He went on to say: "This is an opportunity to attract new visitors to our state and create jobs while generating new revenue for critical state programs."

Casinos in upstate New York include del Lago Resort & Casino in Waterloo, Rivers Casino & Resort in Schenectady, and Tioga Downs Casino & Resort in Nichols.

#  Sports Betting Finally Comes To New York Casinos

After years of being banned, sports betting has finally come to New York casinos. The move is seen as a positive step by many, as it could help generate more revenue for the state. It’s also seen as a way to keep casino players engaged, as they’ll now be able to place bets on their favorite sporting events.

While some are happy about the change, others are concerned that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems. However, officials believe that the new system will include safeguards that will help prevent people from becoming addicted to sports betting.

In any case, sports betting is now officially legal in New York and players are eager to give it a try. The first games that can be bet on are the Super Bowl and the NCAA basketball tournament, and there’s sure to be a lot of interest in both.

It remains to be seen how much money sports betting will bring in for the state, but it’s likely to be a sizeable amount. And with other states following suit, it looks like legalized sports betting is here to stay.

#  NY Casinos Prepare For Sports Betting, But When Will It Actually Happen?

The New York State Gaming Commission is wasting no time in getting its sports betting battle plan ready, but the clock is ticking on when the first bets could actually be placed.

States across the US are preparing for the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the federal prohibition on sports betting. NJ has already launched, PA is gearing up, and now NY is ramping up its efforts.

The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) announced last week that it has retained Spectrum Gaming Group to develop a sports betting regulatory framework. The commission also announced that it will hold a series of public hearings on the issue this summer.

While there is still no set date for when sports betting will become available in New York, the fact that the NYSGC is moving forward with developing a regulatory framework shows that they are serious about getting it up and running as soon as possible.

However, there are still some hurdles that need to be cleared before sports betting can become a reality in New York. One of those hurdles is getting approval from the state legislature.

There is currently a bill before the state legislature that would authorize sports betting in New York. The bill was introduced by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow and has bipartisan support. Pretlow believes that there is enough support in the legislature to get the bill passed this year.

Even if the state legislature does pass a bill authorizing sports betting, there are still other steps that need to be taken before it can become available to bettors. The NYSGC will need to draft regulations and then those regulations will need to be approved by the state’s Gaming Facility Location Board. After that, casinos interested in offering sports betting would need to apply for a license from the board.

It could take several months after all of those approvals have been granted before people would be able to place their first bets on sporting events. But at least there is movement forward on making sports betting a reality in New York.
