#  Massachusetts Approves Casino Gambling Legislation 

On Thursday, November 9th, 2017, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) voted 4-1 in favor of a measure that would allow for casino gambling in the state. The proposal will now go to the state legislature for further review and potential passage into law.

The move to legalize casinos in Massachusetts is seen as a way to bring in more revenue for the state government. Under the proposed legislation, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts would be given the first two licenses to build casinos in Massachusetts. A third license could be awarded later on.

Gaming industry analysts expect that casino gambling in Massachusetts could generate up to $500 million in annual revenue for the state government. This money could be used to help fund transportation infrastructure projects, education initiatives, and other important programs.

While some people are opposed to legalizing casinos in Massachusetts, most believe that it is a sensible move that will benefit the state economy. Supporters of casino gambling argue that it will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to local communities. They also point out that casinos are tightly regulated and monitored by gaming commissions, making them safe places for people to visit and gamble.

It remains to be seen whether or not the proposed legislation will be passed into law by the state legislature. If it is approved, Massachusetts will join other states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Nevada that have already legalized casino gambling.

#  Massachusetts Becomes the Latest State to Legalize Casino Gambling 

Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker has just signed a bill into law that legalizes casino gambling in the state. This makes Massachusetts the latest state to join the growing trend of legalizing casinos.

The new law will allow for three casino resorts to be built in Massachusetts. These casinos will be located in Boston, Springfield, and Western Massachusetts. The exact locations have not yet been determined, but it is expected that a decision on this will be made soon.

Supporters of the new law say that it will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the state. They argue that casinos are a proven way to generate income and that other states that have legalized them have seen positive results.

Opponents of casino gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and social problems. They also say that the promised benefits rarely materialize and that casinos often end up hurting local businesses rather than helping them.

So far, there has been no word on when the first casinos in Massachusetts will open. It is expected, however, that they will be up and running within the next few years.

#  Massachusetts Moves Forward with Casino Gambling Legislation 

 In a historic vote on Wednesday, Massachusetts lawmakers approved a measure that would allow for casino gambling in the state. The bill, which now goes to Governor Charlie Baker for his signature, would establish three casinos and one slots parlor in Massachusetts.

Supporters of the casino gambling legislation say that it will bring much-needed jobs and economic development to the state. Opponents argue that gambling is harmful and will lead to increased crime and social problems.

Governor Baker has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law. If he does, construction on the new casinos could begin as early as this summer.

#  Massachusetts Passes Casino Gambling Legislation Amidst Controversy 

In a controversial vote on Tuesday, Massachusetts legislators passed a bill to allow casino gambling in the state.

The legislation faced strong opposition from some lawmakers and residents who argued that casinos would bring problem gambling and other negative consequences to the state.

Supporters of the bill, including Governor Charlie Baker, argued that casino gambling would bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the state.

The bill now goes to the desk of Governor Baker, who is expected to sign it into law.

#  Massachusetts Passes Casino Gambling Legislation: What Does This Mean for You?

On November 19, 2018, Massachusetts became the latest US state to legalize casino gambling. The new law allows for up to three resort casinos and one slots parlor in the state. Governor Charlie Baker signed the legislation on November 26.

What does this mean for you if you live in Massachusetts? First and foremost, it means that you will now be able to gamble in casinos in your state. This could include playing casino games such as blackjack, poker, and slots, or betting on sports or horse races.

The passage of the bill is also likely to create jobs and bring in additional revenue for the state government. The resorts will be required to pay a license fee of $25 million each, and the slots parlor will have to pay $10 million. In addition, the casinos will be required to pay 35% of their gross gaming revenue to the state government.

Some people have raised concerns about how the legalization of casino gambling will impact crime rates and social welfare costs in Massachusetts. However, a study commissioned by the state found that there would be no significant increase in either crime or social costs.

Overall, the legalization of casino gambling in Massachusetts is good news for residents of the state. It will provide a new form of entertainment and generate much-needed revenue for the government.
