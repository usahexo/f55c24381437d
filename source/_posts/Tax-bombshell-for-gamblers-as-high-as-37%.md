#  Tax bombshell for gamblers as high as 37%

The government has today announced a new 37% tax on gambling winnings, in a bid to fill the black hole in the public finances.

The move will come as a bitter blow to gamblers, who were already facing increased taxes on their bets.

Under the new rules, any individual who wins more than £500 in a single bet will have to pay 37% of their winnings in tax.

The government says that the new tax is essential to help plug the £5bn deficit. But gamblers argue that it will simply drive them underground and deprive the state of much-needed revenue.

Many experts say that the new tax could lead to an increase in illegal gambling. And there are concerns that it could also lead to a decline in tourism, as people look for cheaper places to gamble.

The proposal, announced as part of the government’s budget on Wednesday, means that Canadians who win prizes or other payments from gambling would have to pay federal and provincial income taxes on their winnings.

Under the new rules, the government would tax all gambling winnings at the same rate, regardless of how much money is won. The proposed rate is higher than the current tax rate for other types of income, which range from 15% to 29%.

Opposition MPs criticized the measure, saying that it would penalize people who are already struggling. “It’s just one more way that this government is making life harder for Canadians,” said NDP finance critic Peter Julian.

The Canadian Taxpayers Federation also condemned the proposal, calling it a “cash grab” that would hit low- and middle-income earners hardest.

But Finance Minister Bill Morneau defended the measure, saying that it is important to make sure that everyone pays their fair share. “When we look at our tax system, we need to make sure that it’s fair for everyone, and that includes those who are winning money through gambling activities,” he said.

#  Winners could pay 37% of their gambling earnings in taxes

After a long debate in the Italian Parliament, lawmakers approved a new gambling tax that will come into effect on January 1, 2019. The so-called “Super Casino” bill establishes different tax rates for casino and online gambling providers. 

Online gambling operators will have to pay a 20% flat tax on their earnings, while offline casinos will have to pay 37% of their earnings. This is in line with similar taxes imposed in other European countries such as France and Germany. MPs argued that the new tax is necessary to help protect gamblers from addiction and fraud.

The bill also stipulates that unlicensed online gambling providers will be banned from operating in Italy. This is an attempt to crack down on illegal gaming websites, which have been estimated to account for around 60% of the market. Gambling companies that want to operate in Italy will now need a license from the AAMS, the agency responsible for regulating the industry. 

The Super Casino bill has been criticized by some industry watchers who argue that it will lead to increased prices and reduced competition. Others argue that the new tax rates are too high and could discourage investment in the Italian gaming market. However, most observers agree that the bill represents a step in the right direction for regulating Italy’s growing gambling industry.

#  Taxing gambling winnings: What you need to know

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats gambling winnings as taxable income. This means that you are required to report your winnings on your tax return and may be required to pay taxes on them.

There are a few things you need to know about gambling winnings and taxes:

- You are required to report any gambling winnings of $600 or more on your tax return.

- Gambling losses can be used to offset gambling winnings, but only up to the amount of the winnings. For example, if you had $1,000 in gambling winnings and $1,200 in gambling losses, you would only have to report $200 in gambling income on your tax return.

- Gambling winnings are subject to federal income tax, as well as state and local income taxes, if applicable.

- You may be required to pay taxes on your gambling winnings even if you don't receive a Form W2-G from the casino or other gambling establishment. In these cases, the IRS will expect you to report the amount of your winnings as Other Income on your tax return.

When it comes to paying taxes on your gambling winnings, there are a few options available:

- You can claim the amount of your winnings as income and pay taxes on it that way.

- You can claim a deduction for your losses up to the amount of your winnings. This will reduce the amount of taxable income that you must report.

- You can use a special IRS form (Form 1040NR) to report your gambling income and deductions separately from other types of income. This may be helpful if you have other sources of income that are not reported on Form 1040NR.

#  State, federal government tax gambling winnings

Gambling Winnings are taxable income by the state and federal government. Winnings include cash, the fair market value of non-cash prizes, and any amount over your original bet. The tax rates on gambling winnings depend on the amount won and your filing status. Generally, you must report all gambling winnings as income on your tax return.

Withholding Tax

The casino or other payer of your gambling winnings is required to withhold federal income tax from those winnings at a rate of 24%. This means that for every $100 you win, the casino will withhold $24 and send it to the IRS on your behalf. Some casinos have procedures in place to allow you to claim some or all of this withholding back as a tax deduction on your return. However, whether or not you’re able to do this depends on your individual circumstances.

Reporting Gambling Winnings

You are required to report all gambling winnings on your federal tax return. This includes cash, the fair market value of any non-cash prize, and any amount over your original bet. You report the total amount of all gambling wins for the year on line 21 of Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. This includes both taxable and nontaxable amounts. If you itemize deductions on Schedule A, you can also claim gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling wins. This reduces your taxable income and thus your tax liability.

Tax Rates on Gambling Winnings

The tax rates on gambling winnings vary depending on how much you win and your filing status. For example, if you are single and win more than $5,000 in a year, your gambling income will be taxed at 28%. If you’re married filing jointly and win more than $10,000 in a year, your gambling income will be taxed at 33%. There is no special rate for reporting gambling losses; they are simply deducted from your total taxable income when calculating your tax liability. You can find a complete list of federal income tax rates here.

State Taxes on Gambling Winnings

Most states also levy taxes on gambling winnings. The rate varies from state to state but is generally similar to the federal rate. For example, in California gambling income is taxed at rates that range from 1% to 8%, depending on the amount won and filing status. You can find information about state taxes here.
