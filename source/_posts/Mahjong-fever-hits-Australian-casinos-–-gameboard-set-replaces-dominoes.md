#  Mahjong fever hits Australian casinos – gameboard set replaces dominoes

Mahjong fever has hit Australian casinos in a big way with the gameboard set replacing dominoes at many tables. The popularity of Mahjong is not just restricted to the casinos either, with the game being played by many people in their homes as well.

Originating from China, Mahjong is believed to date back to the late 19th century. The game is thought to have been developed from a Chinese game called “ma jong” which means “sparks”. The aim of Mahjong is to collect sets of tiles with similar designs and then discard them. The first player to achieve this is the winner.

There are a number of variations of Mahjong, but all involve four players who each have a rack of tiles. The tiles are placed face down and are drawn one at a time by each player until they have 14 tiles. These tiles are then placed face up in front of the player.

The aim of the game is to collect sets of tiles with like designs and then discard them. There are different suits and symbols on the tiles, so players need to be aware of what is available when making their move. When a player has formed a set, they can either discard it or declare Mah Jong and win the hand. If two players form a set at the same time, then it is known as pung and the hand is still live.

The first player to form four sets (either discard or declared Mah Jong) plus one extra tile (known as a “chow”) wins the hand and therefore the game.
