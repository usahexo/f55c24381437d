#  How to do the Diamond Casino Heist in GTA V Shamrock n' ROLL game! 

The Diamond Casino Heist is considered as one of the hardest heists in GTA V. The reason for this is because there are many different ways that the mission can be completed and each one has its own set of challenges. In this article, we will provide a detailed guide on how to do the Diamond Casino Heist in Shamrock n' ROLL game.

**Before you start, it is important to note that you will need to have a minimum of $2 million in order to complete the heist.**

1. To start, you will need to head over to the Diamond Casino and Resort. Once you are there, you will need to purchase a High Roller Suite. This can be done by heading over to the front desk and selecting the "Purchasing a High Roller Suite" option.

2. Once you have purchased the High Roller Suite, you will need to head inside and take the elevator up to the penthouse floor. Once you are there, you will need to go into your suite and activate the panel next to the door. This will allow you access to the casino's security room.

3. Once you are in the security room, you will need to hack into the casino's security cameras. This can be done by using either your laptop or your phone. Once you have hacked into the cameras, you will be able to see all of the different areas of the casino.

4. Now that you have access to all of the areas of the casino, it is time to start planning your heist! There are many different ways that you can complete this heist, but we will provide a few examples below: 

a) Option 1: The Simple Heist - In this option, you will simply need to rob the casino's safe and escape from the casino premises. This is considered as one of the easier options, but it can still be challenging if done incorrectly. 

b) Option 2: The Trojan Horse Heist - In this option, you will pretend to be a member of security and gain access to critical areas of the casino. Once you have gained access, you will plant explosives and destroy them once all of your team has escaped safely. 
This option is considered as more complex than Option 1, but it offers a higher payout potential. 

c) Option 3: The All-In Heist - In this option, instead of robbing just the safe, you will rob both the safe and casino's vault simultaneously! This option is by far the most difficult one available, but it offers by far the highest payout potential. 
5 After choosing an option, it is time for phase one of your heist plan! 

a) For Option 1 and 2 (Robbing just Safe), your first step is gaining access to restricted areas such as employee only areas or back rooms where safes are located . You can do this by either posing as an employee or using stolen employee uniforms/access cards . 

Once inside these restricted areas , use bolt cutters or an angle grinder on any locked doors blocking your way . If alarms are triggered while trying to enter these restricted areas , your best bet is usually running away until they reset and come back trying again later when things have died down . 

Once inside these restricted areas , locate safe(s) and empty their contents into your bag(s) . Escape through same route used coming in while avoiding contact with any security personnel . Caution should be taken as some safes may contain tight spaces meaning a small character like Franklin could easily get stuck trying try open it . If alarms trigger during theft , again , make haste escaping through same route used coming in . CAUTION : Do not forget about escape routes before leaving ! It's easy getting cocky when raiding places committing burglary crimes then BOOM , SWAT everywhere arresting everyone when not paying attention leading team members astray ! 

b) For Option 3 (Robbing both Safe & Vault), obtaining keycard/codes for vaults doors would be ideal first step usually found in executive offices on penthouse levels like penthouse suites / presidential suites etcetera . Getting caught with keycard on person would result in being detained until getting released which wastes time so timing here is very important just like actual heist itself . Posing as somebody who works at Diamond such as kitchen staff , janitorial staff or dealer / croupier also works if accessing executive offices isn't possible without being detected too easily which often happens during Phase One unless careful planning was put into place prior executing heist plan ; same goes for Security Room cameraman breaching diamondcasino wall allowed player early entry bypassing lobby entirely which would come handy if wanting avoid everyones attention especially civilians armed guards walking around along with patrolling dogs making things more complicated if seen snooping around too much . 6phase two begins now enter either vaults through front or emergency exits assuming team did their jobs

#  Learn the tricks on how to rob Diamond Casino in GTA V Shamrock n' ROLL game! 

You may have heard about the new heist added in Grand Theft Auto V's latest update, the Diamond Casino & Resort. The casino is a high-roller's paradise, with poker, blackjack, and slots tables catering to the ultra-wealthy. 

The casino also features a secret back room where you can gamble on high-stakes mini-games - but it's not easy to get in there. In this guide, we'll show you how to rob the Diamond Casino in Shamrock n' ROLL, the new game available inside the casino. 

Shamrock n' ROLL is a dice game that's similar to craps. You'll need to make two bets to play: one on the "shamrock" and one on the "ROLL". The shamrock bet pays out at 2:1 if you win, while the ROLL bet pays out at 3:1. 

To start playing, you first need to place your bets. The minimum bet for each is $50, so we recommend starting with at least $100 if you want a decent chance of winning. Next, choose your die - either a shamrock or a ROLL - and place your bet on that number. 

Now comes the tricky part: throwing the dice. There are three ways to throw them: hard (H), normal (N), or soft (S). To make a hard throw, tap H quickly; for a normal throw, tap N; and for a soft throw, tap S slowly. 

The harder you throw them, the more likely they are to land on a specific number - but there's also more risk of them bouncing off the table or ending up in someone else's hand! We recommend trying each type of throw out until you find one that suits your style. 

Once you've thrown the dice, it's time to wait and see if you've won or lost. If your number comes up on both dice, you've won! If only one of your numbers comes up, your bet is still alive and will roll over to the next round. If neither of your numbers come up, you lose your bet. 

So how do you rob the Diamond Casino in Shamrock n' ROLL? It's actually quite simple! Just place two shamrock bets (one for each die) and keep throwing until either of them come up as doubles. Once they do, quickly pick up your money and run!

#  Tips on how to complete the Diamond Casino Heist in GTA V Shamrock n'ROLL game! 

There are a few tips that you should remember when attempting to complete the Diamond Casino Heist in Shamrock n'ROLL game mode on Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V).

1. Plan your approach.

The Diamond Casino Heist is not an easy task, so it is important to plan your approach before you start. Make sure you have a clear idea of what you need to do and how you are going to do it. This will help minimize the amount of time you spend trying to figure out what to do and increase your chances of success.

2. Use stealth whenever possible.

One of the best ways to complete the heist without being detected is by using stealth. This means avoiding combat whenever possible and taking advantage of cover and concealment to move around undetected. If you can get into the casino undetected, you will be able to complete the heist much more easily.

3. Use security cameras to your advantage.

Security cameras can be a great way to scout out the area and see what the enemy is doing. If you can find a security camera that has a good view of the enemy’s position, you can use it to your advantage by keeping an eye on their movements and planning your next move accordingly.

4. Use distractions to draw enemy fire away from your team.

If you are pinned down by enemy fire, one way to draw their attention away from your team is by using distractions. This could involve throwing objects at them or using gunfire or explosives near them in order to get them to focus their fire on something else. Doing this can give your team a chance to move into a better position or take out the enemies more easily.

1. Have a dedicated team
When attempting the Diamond Casino Heist, it's important to have a dedicated team. This means having people who are willing to stay on task and cooperate with each other. The last thing you want is someone who is going to cause drama and slow down the process.

2. Use voice chat
Using voice chat can be extremely helpful when trying to pull off the Diamond Casino Heist. This way, everyone can communicate effectively and make sure they are on the same page. Not only will this help with efficiency, but it will also help keep everyone safe.

3. Make sure everyone knows what they're doing
Before starting the heist, make sure everyone knows their role and what they need to do. This will help avoid any confusion and ensure that things run smoothly. It's also a good idea to practice beforehand so that everyone is familiar with the process.

#  Strategies to follow while playing the Diamond Casino Heist in GTA V Shamrock n'ROLL game

The Diamond Casino Heist in the Shamrock n'ROLL game in GTA V can be a lot of fun, but you need to follow some strategies if you want to make sure that you come out on top. Here are four tips that you should keep in mind while playing the heist:

1. Use cover wisely

One of the most important things to remember while playing any kind of heist is to use cover wisely. This is especially true in the Diamond Casino Heist, where there are many enemies around and they can deal a lot of damage if they manage to hit you. Make sure that you take advantage of the cover available to you and try not to expose yourself too much.

2. Use grenades and other explosives sparingly

While grenades and other explosives can be a lot of fun to use, it’s important to remember that they can also be very damaging to your team if used recklessly. Try to save your grenades and explosives for when they are most likely to be effective, and only use them when there is a clear target for them.

3. Use your teammates as bait

Your teammates can be very useful during the Diamond Casino Heist, so make sure that you use them to your advantage. One way to do this is by using them as bait – draw the attention of enemies towards them while you take them out from behind. This will help reduce the amount of damage that you take during the heist.

4. Plan your route ahead of time

Another important thing to remember while playing the Diamond Casino Heist is to plan your route ahead of time. This will help ensure that you don’t get lost or stuck in a difficult situation during the heist. Make sure that you know where all of the objectives are and try to come up with a plan for how you will complete them.
